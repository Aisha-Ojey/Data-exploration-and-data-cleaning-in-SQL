# Data Exploration and Data Cleaning using SQL (COVID-19 DATASET AND The Nashville Housing dataset)

This repository contains SQL queries and scripts for exploring COVID-19 data as of May 2021 and for cleaning data from the Nashville Housing dataset. The project utilizes various SQL techniques such as Joins, CTEs (Common Table Expressions), Temporary Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types to analyze and process the data.


### Introduction

This repository showcases SQL queries and scripts for two distinct tasks: exploring COVID-19 data up to May 2021 and cleaning data from the Nashville Housing dataset. SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to retrieve, analyze, and manipulate the data, showcasing various advanced SQL techniques.

### COVID-19 Data Exploration

### Dataset
The COVID-19 data is sourced from the Our World in Data COVID-19 Deaths dataset, providing information about COVID-19 related deaths. The dataset contains various attributes including date, location, total deaths, and more.

### Skills Used

Joins: Combining multiple tables based on shared columns.
CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Creating temporary result sets for complex queries.
Temporary Tables: Storing intermediate results for further analysis.
Window Functions: Performing calculations over specific result sets.
Aggregate Functions: Computing summary statistics like sums, counts, etc.
Creating Views: Creating virtual tables for simplified querying.
Converting Data Types: Changing the data type of specific columns.

### Queries

The SQL queries in this section cover exploratory tasks such as calculating statistics, identifying trends, and generating insights from the COVID-19 data. The queries are designed to showcase the mentioned skills.

## Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

### Dataset

The Nashville Housing dataset contains information about housing properties in Nashville. The dataset may require cleaning and preparation for further analysis.

### Queries

The SQL queries in this section address data cleaning tasks, which might include handling missing values, standardizing formats, and correcting inconsistencies in the Nashville Housing dataset.
